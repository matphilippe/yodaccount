## An accounting app
---------------------

One project to cease meaningless arguments about budgetting!
I felt like this was a good start to train with python.
The design choices may not be the best, but it is a good exercise in software design.

Inspired by YNAB (see here https://www.youneedabudget.com/). 


## Philosophy
--------------------

We are here to help you. 
Budgetting is often perceived as a daunting and stressfull task, to the point where many of my friends (and by first order extrapolation, I assume this to be true for many people) just don't do it. And why do it?

Because projects matter.
There are many things we want to do and achieve and more often than not, money will be involved. Since our access to it is limited, it is often necessary to compromise: should I buy a new computer or put money on the side for a new car? Should I go get a burger or save the money to eat to a fancier restaurant later?  
As life gets more complicated (new loans, new jobs, spouse and childs), your general accounting needs can only grow. You may need to manage multiple accounts and some may even be dedicated to pay bills while other may be focused on groceries. We don't know how it gets there, but it gets tiring...

Anyways, lets put some order into this mess. Let's start from a clean picture, set out some goals, and make just make things work.

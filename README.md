## An accounting app
---------------------

One project to cease meaningless arguments about budgetting!
I felt like this was a good start to train with python.
The design choices may not be the best, but it is a good exercise in software design.

Inspired by YNAB (see here https://www.youneedabudget.com/). 


## Philosophy
--------------------

We are here to help you. 
Budgetting is often perceived as a daunting and stressfull task, to the point where many of my friends (and by first order extrapolation, I assume this to be true for many people) just don't do it. And why do it?

Because projects matter.
There are many things we want to do and achieve and more often than not, money will be involved. Since our access to it is limited, it is often necessary to compromise: should I buy a new computer or put money on the side for a new car? Should I go get a burger or save the money to eat to a fancier restaurant later?  
As life gets more complicated (new loans, new jobs, spouse and childs), your general accounting needs can only grow. You may need to manage multiple accounts and some may even be dedicated to pay bills while other may be focused on groceries. We don't know how it gets there, but it gets tiring...

Anyways, lets put some order into this mess. Let's start from a clean picture, set out some goals, and make just make things work.

### The core of your accounting
-------------------------------

#### What is considered as money?

We exchange amounts of money for goods and services. One kudo (our fictional money unit) which is to be spend on ice-scream can not be distinguished from a kudo to be saved for paying the rent. This may aleviate some concerns when budgetting: if your only concern is to save 200 kudos, then you should not care about where the kudos come from: if there are 200 kudos __available__ somewhere on some of your accounts, feel free to use them. 

Money is something you can allocate freely (if available) within your budget. When we reason like this, food stamps for example  should not be considered money as you can't use them to pay your phone bills. Get it?
That's something else that may help: focus your budgetting efforts on money. If you can spend less money on groceries because of food stamp, good for you. We won't care, as this would add unnecessary complications.


#### Accounts

To us, Accounts are places where you store money. That's it.   
The money you store in there can have different purposes of course! However, we will try to keep things as simple as possible: for each possible use of our money, we associate one (or a few) accounts to store money for this usage. Examples: 
1. The money to be spent on the bills should be found on a spendings account,
2. The money that is being saved for buying a house with your spouse should be split 50/50 on both your saving accounts.

#### Categories

These are the possible uses for your money. Classical spending categories are "bills", which may contain "rent, electricity", etc...
